 ⚠️ **Warning: Linux-Only Compatibility**

 This Flask application is designed to run on **Linux-based systems only**.

 On **Windows**, file paths may be automatically altered — forward slashes (`/`) used in image URLs are converted to backslashes (`\`), which then appear as `%5C` in the browser. This can cause image loading issues or broken links.

 ✅ Please run this application on a **Linux environment** to ensure proper image path handling and overall compatibility.
